<p>My name is Hersson Ceballos. I am originally from Medellin, Colombia but i have spent most of my years in the US, specifically the east coast. When someone goes out of their comfort zone to better themselves is when great things happen. With this new journey i am in, software engineering, i am for sure testing my sanity. Although, it is like learning a new language i am most hopeful that once i become fluent in whatever languages flatiron can help us learn i would then be able to use this discipline and knowledge to explore areas i find interesting. Right now, i am very into artificial intelligence because i love the idea of being able to use software and human ingenuity to work efficiently. Thank you for reading. I am excited about our new journey into this fascinating world of technology.</p>
